### Extra validation required
1. Response/ Request Headers for a POST request  to /hash endpoint (accepts null as a Header name( key value). Curl accepts different Headers while POSTMAN needs specific Headers
2. Payload for a POST request  to /hash endpoint (AC is not clear what is acceptable for request body, length, special characters, also accepts empty  and null values )
3. Response Body for job identifier (valid response headers and also negative)
4. Response data structure 
5. Validation of Stats info (for example compare with database info)
6. Handling Error Messages
7. Need to define timing response for job identifier, in AC refers to  immediately (specific range required for testing).
8. From AC need clarification: "It should then wait 5 seconds and compute the password hash."5 seconds takes to return jobIdentifier, seems no need to wait after. 
user able to perform GET request to retrieve encoded password after getting jobIdentifier
9. Hard to verify No additional password requests should be allowed when shutdown is pending. Shutdown process so fast, not sure if I was able to cover this AC

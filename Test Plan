Scope of the tests: Verify the application supports three endpoints.


Test cases:
##Verify POST request to “/hash” endpoint
1."should verify POST request to  “/hash” endpoint with Header name accepts a password and return a job identifier."
2."should verify POST request to  “/hash” endpoint without Header name accepts a password and return a job identifier."
3."should verify POST request to  “/hash” endpoint with incorrect value parameters are not allowed."
4."should verify timing response to return job identifier from POST request to /hash endpoint"


##Verify GET request to “/hash” endpoint
1."should verify GET request to “/hash” endpoint accepts job identifier and returned base64 encoded password hash for the corresponding POST request"
2."should verify GET request to “/hash” endpoint without Header name accepts job identifier and returned base64 encoded password hash for the corresponding POST request
3."should verify GET request to “/hash” endpoint doesn't allowed unexistent jobIdentifier."
4."should verify hashing algorithm is SHA512."

##Verify GET request to /stats endpoint
1."should verify GET request to "/stats" endpoint return totalRequest value with AverageTime value
2."should verify a GET request to '/stats' endpoint should accept no data."


##Verify POST request to “/hash” endpoint
1."should verify during software shutdown process it  should allow any in-flight password hashing to complete"
2."should verify shutdown request returned status code 200."
